Cards are lined up in the code. It is start with main(0.0) command. We're expecting that when you see the 
"Please inputs your input data x to play game:" line, give an integer as an input and put the dot at the end.
("Please inputs your input data x to play game: 1.") and "Please inputs your input data y to play game:", 
same for this data. Game will tell you if it is match or not and if it's not match then
its gives you some information that contains which card are occupied at your selected index. 
Also, there are 8 cards. All card has number, starting 1 to 8. We are expecting you to get all 8 match to finish
game.

scenario if you scrool down. The site couldnt provide that inputs can be given one by one so I already typed all
needed input.
