# Prolog-CardGame
 
The game start with cards as 4x4 matrix form. <br />
[_ _ _ _ <br />
					                                          _ _ _ _ <br />
					                                          _ _ _ _ <br />
					                                          _ _ _ _]		(in this form.)<br />
Cards are lined up in the code. It is start with main(0.0) command. We're expecting that when you see the <br />
"Please inputs your input data x to play game:" line, give an integer as an input and put the dot at the end.<br />
("Please inputs your input data x to play game: 1.") and "Please inputs your input data y to play game:", <br />
same for this data. Game will tell you if it is match or not and if it's not match then<br />
its gives you some information that contains which card are occupied at your selected index. <br />
Also, there are 8 cards. All card has number, starting 1 to 8. We are expecting you to get all 8 match to finish<br />
game. <br />
https://rextester.com/ZYNDP69981 : this is link that one example of code that are already executed. You can see <br />
scenario if you scrool down. The site couldnt provide that inputs can be given one by one so I already typed all<br />
needed input.<br />
